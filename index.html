        <p>My favorite trip that we take or at least stop by is a little island called balboa island. It is a little man-made island that my family has been going to for years. When I was younger, we use to rent a beachouse, but recently it has been a daytrip, which is still incredibly fun. I have and will love every trip to balboa.</p>

<p>FLAMINGO- This colorful bird has plumage that is a distinctive pink color with black flight feathers along the edges of the wings. It has a slender body and very long legs, a long, flexible neck and a small head. The flamingo's bill has a characteristic downward bend. Compared with its long legs, a flamingo's feet are relatively small.</p>
